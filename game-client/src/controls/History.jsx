      <h3>Games short history</h3>
      <p>The <b>history of games</b> dates to the ancient human past. Games are an integral part of all cultures and are
        one
        of the oldest forms of human social interaction. Games are formalized expressions of play which allow people to
        go beyond immediate imagination and direct physical activity. Common features of games include uncertainty of
        outcome, agreed upon rules, competition, separate place and time, elements of fiction, elements of chance,
        prescribed goals and personal enjoyment.</p>
      <p>Games capture the ideas and worldviews of their cultures and pass them on to the future generation. Games were
        important as cultural and social bonding events, as teaching tools and as markers of social status. As pastimes
        of royalty and the elite, some games became common features of court culture and were also given as gifts. Games
        such as Senet and the Mesoamerican ball game were often imbued with mythic and ritual religious significance.
        Games like Gyan chauper and The Mansion of Happiness were used to teach spiritual and ethical lessons while
        Shatranj and Wéiqí (Go) were seen as a way to develop strategic thinking and mental skill by the political and
        military elite.</p>
      <p>In his 1938 book, Homo Ludens, Dutch cultural historian Johan Huizinga argued that games were a primary
        condition of the generation of human cultures. Huizinga saw the playing of games as something that &quot;is
        older
        than culture, for culture, however inadequately defined, always presupposes human society, and animals have not
        waited for man to teach them their playing&quot;. Huizinga saw games as a starting point for complex human
        activities such as language, law, war, philosophy and art.</p>
      <p>Some of the most common pre-historic and ancient gaming tools were made of bone, especially from the Talus
        bone, these have been found worldwide and are the ancestors of knucklebones as well as dice games. These
        bones were also sometimes used for oracular and divinatory functions. Other implements could have included
        shells, stones and sticks.
        In ancient civilizations there was no clear distinction between the sacred and the profane. According to
        Durkheim, games were founded in a religious setting and were a cornerstone of social bonding.</p>
