      <h1>Games</h1>
      <p>A game is something that people often do for fun. If so, it is different from work. Many sports are games, and
        there are many professional sports. In those cases, there is money to be made, because it is a type of
        entertainment.</p>

      <p>There are different kinds of games using many kinds of equipment. For example, in video games, people often use
        controllers or their keyboard to control what happens on a screen, such as a television screens and computers
        ones
        too. In card games, players use playing cards. There are also games that use your body, such as the Kinect. Most
        games need equipment, but not always. Children&apos;s street games often need no equipment.</p>

      <p>In board games, players may move pieces on a flat surface called a board. The object of the game varies. In
        race-type games like ludo, the object is to reach the end first. In go the object is to surround more space. In
        soccer it is to score more goals. Some games have complicated rules, some have simple rules.</p>
